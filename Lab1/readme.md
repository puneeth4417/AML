In this Lab, we looked into Linear and Non-linear Data.

data.py --> We r creating the features and label space for linear and XOR data

visual.py --> Here we are plotting the graph based on the data

task0.py --> This is to plot the graph to represent linear data

task1.py --> This is to plot the graph to represent XOR data

task2.py --> This task demonstrates why Logistic Regression struggles with XOR data when trained on the original feature space. 
By applying polynomial feature transformation, the data becomes easier to separate, allowing the same model to achieve much higher accuracy. 
This helps us understand the importance of feature engineering in machine learning.
